===========================================

This is a small problem that we would like you to solve so that we can get an idea of your coding ability.
Your submission will be run in a clean environment to see if it produces the expected output.

You can expect that the input will be well-formed. There is no need to add
special handling for malformed input files.

The rules
---------
In this league, a draw (tie) is worth 1 point and a win is worth 3 points. A
loss is worth 0 points. If two or more teams have the same number of points,
they should have the same rank and be printed in alphabetical order (as in the
tie for 3rd place in the sample data).

Guidelines
-----------
This should be implemented in ruby.

Your solution should be able to be run from the command line. Please include appropriate scripts and instructions for
running your application and your tests.

If you use other libraries installed by rubygems/bundler it is not necessary to
commit the installed packages.

We write automated tests and we would like you to do so as well.

We appreciate well factored, object-oriented or functional designs.

Please document any steps necessary to run your solution and your tests.

Platform support
----------------
This will be run in a unix-ish environment (OS X).
